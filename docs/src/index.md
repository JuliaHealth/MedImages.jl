<h1> What is MedImages.jl? </h1>

MedImages is a package for standardizing data handling of 3D and 4D medical images, with additional support for analysis and modification.

It is meant to be used in conjunction with the `MedEye3d` visualization package, which further will be integrated within a pipeline `MedPipe3D`!

<h2> Basic usage </h2>


1. Import the package MedImages within a Julia REPL,
2. Pass an `image file path` to `load_image` to get a MedImage object:

```julia
using MedImages
image_path = "/path/to/your/image"
medimage_container = MedImages.load_image(image_path)

help(medimage_container)
```
and enjoy the fruits of your labour!
